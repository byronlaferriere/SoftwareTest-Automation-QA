How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Modularity is one way of ensuring that software is being written in a functinonal manner. Automated testing can be used to guide engineers through writing code by defining 
parameters that can not be broken. This also provides security that if changes are made, the tests will run them against previously defined functionality requirements and alert 
someone if the changes will cause failure.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Requirement documentation is an example of one way to interpret user needs that the program will need to have. This document is usually provided by the Product Owner who interacts 
with the client to extrapolate the needs of the software.

How do I approach designing software?

Software design should be approached keeping two things in mind. First, functionality requirements need to be considered and should be used as a guideline for what the customer 
expects the program to do. Secondly, the software design should always keep internal structure in mind.
